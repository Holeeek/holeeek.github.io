I"‘<p>Hi! My name is Maciej (â€œmah-chayâ€ or just call me Matt).</p>

<p>Born and raised in Poland, I moved to the US for college when I was 19. I spent the first three years at Harvard pursuing a mix of Statistics, Computer Science and Finance. I also focused heavily on East Asia, having participated in a summer school in Japan, having interned in China twice, and having studied Mandarin for 3 years.</p>

<p>After junior year I realized I wasnâ€™t sure what I want to do after graduation, and spontaneously decided to take a gap year. I spent the next 14 months exploring different career paths I could pursue. I spent the first few months at home in Warsaw, interning as a strategy analyst at White Star Real Estate and later as an associate consultant at Bain &amp; Company. I then moved to London, where I explored the world of credit risk at Mercuria Energy Trading. Finally, I spent my summer in Singapore working at J.P. Morganâ€™s investment banking division.</p>

<p>The year off taught me that I want to focus on social impact and entrepreneurship. Thatâ€™s why after returning to Harvard I co-founded <span class="bold"><a href="https://newspark.us">newspark</a></span> and became an advisor at <span class="bold"><a href="https://off.org.pl/en/">Our Future Foundation</a></span>.</p>

<p>(My name is notoriously hard to pronunce. The closed phonetic description is â€œmah-chayâ€. Or you can call me Matt)</p>
