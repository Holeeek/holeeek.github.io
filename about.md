Hi! My name is Maciej ("mah-chay" or just call me Matt).

Born and raised in Poland, I moved to the US for college when I was 19. I spent the first three years at Harvard pursuing a mix of Statistics, Computer Science and Finance. I also focused heavily on East Asia, having participated in a summer school in Japan, having interned in China twice, and having studied Mandarin for 3 years.

After junior year I realized I wasn't sure what I want to do after graduation, and spontaneously decided to take a gap year. I spent the next 14 months exploring different career paths I could pursue. I spent the first few months at home in Warsaw, interning as a strategy analyst at White Star Real Estate and later as an associate consultant at Bain & Company. I then moved to London, where I explored the world of credit risk at Mercuria Energy Trading. Finally, I spent my summer in Singapore working at J.P. Morgan's investment banking division.

The year off taught me that I want to focus on social impact and entrepreneurship. That's why after returning to Harvard I co-founded <span class="bold">[newspark](https://newspark.us)</span> and became an advisor at <span class="bold">[Our Future Foundation](https://off.org.pl/en/)</span>.
